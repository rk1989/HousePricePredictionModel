## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price
- The company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market
- The company wants to know:
  Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and 
  How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables
- The model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Lambda values for Ridge and Lasso Regression are 50 and 500 respectively
- Ridge and Lasso Regression performed well than Linear Regression
- R2 scores for Ridge and Lasso are 0.73 and 0.72 respectively (on Test data)
  whereas Linear Regression had R2 score of 0.7 (on Test data)
- Lasso Regression provided feature elimination options
- With Lasso Regression following features were eliminated -
  BsmtUnSF, 2ndFlrSF, LowQualFinSF, 3SsnPorch, PoolArea, all_utilities, prox_NS, prox_adj, lot_inside, foundation_cinder, mansory_type_available, and 1_Story_1946
  - See Jupyter notebook for a list of significant variables in predicting the price of a house,
- The top 5 predictors in the Lasso model (before removing them) are â€“ 
  - GrLivArea                
  - TotalBsmtSF              
  - GarageCars              
  - BsmtFinSF1                
  - LotArea
